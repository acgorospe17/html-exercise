        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element is not sectioning content and therefore does not introduce a new section in the outline. That said, a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element is intended to usually contain the surrounding section's heading (an <code>h1</code>â€“<code>h6</code> element), but this is <strong>not</strong> required.</li>

        <article>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <span><a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a></span> uses a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> for their primary navigation module, which with my very novice understanding appears to be used correctly.

        <h2><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element. <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> is intended only for major block of navigation links; typically the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.</li>
            <li>A document may have several <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra-page navigation. aria-labelledby can be used in such case to promote accessibility, see example.</li>
            <li>User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of navigation-only content.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <article>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <span><a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a></span> also uses a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for their primary navigation module, which again with my very novice understanding appears to be used correctly.

      <section>
        <h2><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The content of a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the main function of the page.</li>
          <li><main> doesn't contribute to the document's outline; that is, unlike elements such as <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, headings such as <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and such, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> doesn't affect the DOM's concept of the structure of the page. It's strictly informative.</li>
        </ul>
        <article>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <span><a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a></span> also uses a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>. Feeling redundant at this point, but it looks correct to me.
        </article>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>As mentioned above, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it. As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element, but a list of search results or a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>To reiterate, each <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> element) as a child of the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element, wherever possible. See below for examples of where you might see a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> without a heading.</li>
        </ul>
        <article>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <span><a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a></span> uses many <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements, but I actually think they abuse the section element rather than using it to logically "section" elements of <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>. I'm not confident (as the code base is pretty large), but it appears as though they are interchangeably using <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.

            <p>Here is an aside.</p>

      <section>
        <h2><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Each <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> element) as a child of the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element.</li>
          <li>When an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements nested in the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> representing the blog post.</li>
          <li>Author information of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>element can be provided through the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements.</li>
          <li>The publication date and time of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element can be described using the datetime attribute of a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element. Note that the pubdate attribute of <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> is no longer a part of the W3C HTML5 standard.</li>
        </ul>
        <article><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></span> doesn't use an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag specifically on their home page, but they declare some elements as articles. I believe the "flair" feature is being presented as an article--not sure if this is appropriate use or not.</article>
